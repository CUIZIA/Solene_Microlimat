## Objective

The goal of this sensitivity analysis is to evaluate the impact of four input parameters on the simulated surface temperature over time. The parameters are:
- Conductivite thermique (Thermal Conductivity)
- Capacite thermique (Heat Capacity)
- Masse volumique (Density)
- Albedo (Surface Reflectivity)

## Steps
**1** Establish a Baseline Model:
- Select a set of baseline values for the four parameters. These should represent reasonable and typical values for the materials or conditions being simulated.
- Run the simulation with these baseline values to generate the baseline temperature profile over time.

**2** Parameter Variation and Simulation:
- Perform four separate simulations, each time modifying only one of the input parameters, while keeping the other three parameters at their baseline values.
- For each simulation, change the selected parameter by increasing and decreasing its baseline value by 50%. This will help assess the sensitivity of the surface temperature to changes in that parameter.

**3** Simulations:
- Simulation 1: Vary Conductivite thermique by ±50% from the baseline.
- Simulation 2: Vary Capacite thermique by ±50% from the baseline.
- Simulation 3: Vary Masse volumique by ±50% from the baseline.
- Simulation 4: Vary Albedo by ±50% from the baseline.

**4** Results Comparison:
- Compare the temperature profiles from each of the four simulations against the baseline profile.
- Analyze how the changes in each parameter affect the surface temperature over time.

**5** Visualization:
- Plot the temperature profiles from all simulations on a single graph, with the baseline temperature profile as a reference.
- Use additional bar charts or other appropriate visualizations to highlight key differences at specific time points (e.g., maximum temperature or time to reach a certain temperature).

**6** Conclusion:
- Identify which parameters have the most significant impact on the surface temperature.
- Discuss any potential interactions or non-linear effects observed during the analysis.
- Based on the findings, recommend any further analysis or adjustments to the simulation parameters.
