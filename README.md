# Solene_Microlimat
Welcome to the Solene_Microclimat Code Repository! This repository is dedicated to storing, organizing, and managing various code snippets and projects that are applicable to the Solene_Microclimat simulation tool. SOLENE-Microclimat enables the calculation of thermal balances of urban surfaces and buildings using digital models, and models the urban climate on a neighborhood scale. Here, I will primarily focus on the 'SOLENE' part, excluding considerations of CFD.

Purpose
Throughout my experience with this simulation tool, I have encountered numerous challenges. My goal is to create a comprehensive guide to assist future users in overcoming similar obstacles.

Submodels
SOLENE-Microclimat consists of numerous submodels developed by various contributors, including but not limited to:

2.0 2.1: Model by J. Bouyer and L. Malys
2.2: Sol MH Azam Model
2.3: B. Bouyer Model
...
Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient Models
One significant limitation of the current models is the lack of appropriate convective heat transfer coefficient models. This repository provides a summary of several models that I plan to test with different materials, facets, and positions.
