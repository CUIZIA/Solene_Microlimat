## Hybrid model: Merge of 3R4C and Finite Differences model

The above study focuses on the simulation of ground surface temperatures. However, in other studies, it was observed that the 3R4C 
model for simulating urban building surface temperatures appears to be a good compromise between accuracy and complexity. Therefore, 
we combined the finite differences conductive model for the ground with the 3R4C model for building surfaces. We refer to the integrated 
model as ‘simulation_Ts_EnergieBat_mixture’, which has been shared on Box for download and review, including the source code.
