# Wind Speed Distribution Model

## Project Overview

This project models the distribution of wind speed with respect to height, taking into account **vertical wind shear**â€”the phenomenon where wind speed changes with altitude. The model is based on the logarithmic wind profile law, which also considers the effect of surface roughness on wind speed distribution.

## Wind Speed Distribution Formula

The relationship between wind speed at different heights can be described using the following logarithmic formula:

$$
\frac{v(z)}{v_{\text{ref}}} = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{z}{z_0}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{z_{\text{ref}}}{z_0}\right)}
$$

Where:

- \( v(z) \) is the wind speed at height \( z \)
- \( v_{\text{ref}} \) is the wind speed at the reference height \( z_{\text{ref}} \)
- \( z_0 \) is the surface roughness length

## Surface Roughness Length Values \( z_0 \)

The surface roughness length \( z_0 \) varies depending on the type of terrain:

| Surface Type        | \( z_0 \) (meters) |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Open water          | 0.0002             |
| Short grass         | 0.03               |
| Farmland            | 0.1                |
| Urban area          | 1.0                |
| Forest              | 1.3                |

By adjusting the surface roughness length \( z_0 \), the model can simulate wind speed distribution in different environments. This model is particularly useful for studies related to wind farm siting and other wind energy applications.

## Usage Example

You can calculate the wind speed at a certain height using the following Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

def wind_speed_at_height(z, v_ref, z_ref, z_0):
    return v_ref * np.log(z / z_0) / np.log(z_ref / z_0)

# Example parameters
z = 50  # Target height (meters)
v_ref = 10  # Wind speed at reference height (m/s)
z_ref = 10  # Reference height (meters)
z_0 = 0.03  # Surface roughness for short grass (meters)

v_z = wind_speed_at_height(z, v_ref, z_ref, z_0)
print(f"Wind speed at {z} meters: {v_z:.2f} m/s")
